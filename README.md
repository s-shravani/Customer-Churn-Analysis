# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

This repository contains code for churn prediction in the telecom industry using Logistic Regression. The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify potential churners among customers, helping telecom companies take proactive measures to retain valuable subscribers.

A] Dataset

The dataset used for this churn prediction task is located in the repository itself. You can also find datasets on kaggle.

B] Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a powerful classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks, making it well-suited for churn prediction. It estimates the probability of a customer churning based on input features and assigns a binary label.

C] Model Evaluation

After training the Logistic Regression model, the repository includes code for evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Proper model evaluation is crucial to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting churn and make informed business decisions.
